ALB and NLB difference 
  ALB supports host,path,content-based routing and Layer 7 based routing (HTTP/HTTPS)
  NLB does not support and Layer4 based routing (TCP/UDP) and IP addresses
  
  ALB routes to EC2 instances,IP addresses,Lambda and ECS containers
  NLB routes to EC2 instances and IP addresses only

Why do we need Route53
 registering a domain to make it available globally
 health check endpoints to route traffic to healthy endpoitn
 translates domain to IP address ,mx
