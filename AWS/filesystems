S3=>simple storage bucket 
efs=>faster than S3 and slower than EBS and can be accessible through instances as well as aws services scalble 
     can be attached to multiple instances
     
     throughtput types:elastic throughput,provisioned throughput and bursting 
     elastic throughput: it will be useful if ur workloads could meet unpredictable peak
     provisioned throughout:if we know the performance of our requirements 
     bursting throughput:it scales as per the amount of storage 
ebs=>not scable faster than other and can be accessible thrrugh ec2 instances only
     cant be attached to mulitple instances
