   PUBLIC =>can access the internet through gateway and private instance ,usually ALB sits in public subnet 
INTERNET GATEWAY=>like an entrypoint for vpc
ROUTE TABLE=>it contains list of ip range (CIDR) and contains igw and local 
   igw is for route the traffic to internet through IGW
   local is for route the traffic within vpc (for eg: subnet CIDR range should be mentioned to route traffic to that subnet)
NACL=>network access control list ,contains list of rules of applying that to subnet level
NAT=>useful for private subnet resources to connect with internet for downloading security patches and packages
VPC ENDPOINTS=>
TRANSIT GATEWAY=>it is a central hub where multiple vpc can be connected and share the traffic
VPC PEERING =>to connect two vpc 
AWS DIRECT CONNECT=>to connect aws vpc and on premises network
VPC FLOW LOGS=> to monitor the vpc traffice flows and logs
