IAM principle creation using IAM role for creating cluster 
  create role for eks service and give action to assume roles
IAM roles for worker nodes 
  eks cluster policy ,create policy to make calls to EC2 instances ,secruity groups ,vpc and all
  to create loadbalancer ,we have to create custom policy
  create a role for eks cluster to get policy assigned on behalf of cluster 
  Security considerations:
     when u create cluster,it will create a security group for node to node communicaion ,vpc and allow access to 443,53 (DNS) ,10250 ports 
     we have to mention cidr range for services 10. 172. or 192.0 if it is ipv4
     if it is ipv6 ,then we cant control the ip assign,
VPC CNI plugin for ENI configurations 
worker node sizes in our project 
    c6i.2Xlarge=>10 nodes=>cluster autoscaler=>HPA with KEDA => VPA 
    g5.4Xlarge=>4 nodes => CA=>HPA=>VPA
EBS volume with 500gib with gp2 planning to move gp3
addons =>
  VPC CNI
  EBS CSI DRIVER 
  KUBE PROXY 
  CORE DNS 
Authentication mode : configmap .
IP family => ipv4 and ipv6
VPC
Subnet=>private subnets (2), protected subnets(2)
access endpoints=> public with limited CIDR,and private access
we use launch template for bootstrap comments ,volume attachment ,security group and all
we connect our private subnets with tgw to connect multiple vpc 
we have igw also in public subnets
