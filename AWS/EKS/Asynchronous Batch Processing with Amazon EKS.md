## Demonstrate how to use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for running cost-effective batch processing and big data workloads. 
We'll focus on optimizing EKS for asynchronous batch tasks and provide a detailed README.md for your GitHub repository.

## Sample Project: Asynchronous Batch Processing with Amazon EKS

### Overview
This tutorial will guide you through the preconfiguration of an Amazon EKS cluster specifically designed to handle small- to medium-scale asynchronous background tasks. We'll use an `eksctl` "quickstart" template to set up the cluster¬≤. The project includes a Python-based batch processing application that reads, processes, and writes data in batches using Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for persistent storage¬≥.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- `eksctl` installed (for creating the EKS cluster)
- Docker installed (for building container images)

### Steps

1. **Create an EKS Cluster**
   - Use `eksctl` to create an EKS cluster with the appropriate configuration for batch processing workloads. You can customize the cluster size, instance types, and networking settings.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     eksctl create cluster --name my-eks-cluster --node-type t3.medium --nodes 2 --region us-west-2
     ```

2. **Deploy the Batch Processing Application**
   - Clone the sample project repository.
   - Build a Docker image for your batch processing application.
   - Deploy the application to your EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, etc.).

3. **Configure SQS and EFS**
   - Create an SQS queue to handle asynchronous tasks.
   - Set up an EFS file system for persistent storage.
   - Modify your batch processing application to read from the SQS queue and write to the EFS volume.

4. **Scale and Monitor**
   - Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically scale your batch processing pods based on CPU or memory utilization.
   - Monitor your EKS cluster using Amazon CloudWatch and Prometheus/Grafana for insights into resource usage and performance.

### Running the Sample Application
1. Deploy the application to your EKS cluster.
2. Send messages to the SQS queue (representing batch processing tasks).
3. Observe how the application processes the messages asynchronously.
4. Check the EFS volume for any persistent data generated by the application.

### Cleanup
Don't forget to delete your EKS cluster and associated resources when you're done testing.

### Conclusion
By following this sample project, you'll have a cost-effective setup for running batch processing workloads on Amazon EKS. Feel free to customize the application, explore other data frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Ray, or Kubeflow), and optimize further based on your specific use case.
