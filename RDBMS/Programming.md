## Programming Paradigms
Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized. 
Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled¹. 
Here are some of the popular programming paradigms:

    **Imperative Programming**:
    
    - This paradigm involves programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state⁵. It directly controls the execution flow and state change².
    
    **Declarative Programming**:
    
    - In this paradigm, you specify the result you want, not how to get it⁵. Code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it².
    
    **Structured Programming**:
    
    - This involves programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures⁵.
    
    **Procedural Programming**:
    
    - This is a subtype of imperative programming, organized as procedures that call each other².
    
    **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    
    - This paradigm organizes programs as objects that contain both data structure and associated behavior². It's about grouping into units that include both state and behavior².
    
    **Functional Programming**:
    
    - Treats programs as evaluating mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data³. A desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations².
    
    **Logical Programming**:
    
    - This paradigm is based on formal logic. A program written in a logical language describes the problem to be solved, and the execution engine finds the solution⁴.
