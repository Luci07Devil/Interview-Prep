Istio components 
   Control Plane =>Istiod(Pilot,citadel,galley)
           Pilot=>If any new pod comes up that pod envoy will send out info(IP) to pilot and pilot will propagate that to all other envoys (service discovery)
           Citadel=>responsible for end to end authentication between the services and encryption of traffic between them
           Galley=>Respsonible for covnerting yaml to kubernetes to istio format 

   Data Plane=>all the envoy side car containers or envoy proxies are istio

Virtual Service and destionation rule 
   Virtual service contains the host and subset service URI
   Destination rule contains where the traffice should go to


ingress Gateway=> envoy proxy to allow the incoming traffic outside service mesh
      API gateway object mentions the hosts allowed from outside to access and virtual service to route the traffice from this gateway 
Egress Gateway=> envoy proxy to allow outgoing traffic from service mesh like database 
     for egress gateway teo components are requirede 
      if(istio configmap says REGISTER_ONLY) else (ALLOW_ANY) :follwing doest not require
        1.service entry  => register the service to flow traffic from service mesh to external service ,we mention the DNS port number and all
        2.virtual service =>to control the traffic flow from service mesh to external service 

Kiali dashboard visualise the traffic flow and easily understand the components in istio in particular cluster
