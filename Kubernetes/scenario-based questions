Kubernetes CrashLoopBackOff error: What is it & how to fix it? 🤔 

CrashLoopBackoff is an error state that occurs when a Pod fails to start, K8s tries to restart it, it fails again and this cycle continues.

This usually means that a deeper problem is consistently causing your Pod to crash upon startup.

💡 You can easily detect if your Pod is experiencing this error. Run “kubectl get pods”. The faulty Pod’s status is “CrashLoopBackOff”.


Why is K8s restarting the bad Pod?
👉 A Pod’s default Restart policy is “Always”, so K8s will always attempt to restart a Pod that has crashed (you can configure this behavior).
👉 Every time the Pod is restarted, K8s waits for a longer duration before attempting the next restart. This is known as Exponential back-off delay.
During this period, the Pod’s status is set to “CrashLoopBackOff”.


How do I fix this?

1️⃣ Check the logs
Use “kubectl logs <pod-name>” to know what’s actually going on inside your pod’s container(s). Most likely this will reveal why your app is unable to start.

2️⃣ Ensure sufficient resources
Insufficient CPU/Memory can cause pods to crash. Set appropriate resource limits and deploy on Nodes that can actually provide a sufficient amount.

3️⃣ Check for Image issues
Often, the container image you specified does not exist or is in a private repository and your authentication is misconfigured. K8s can never pull the image to run in such cases.

4️⃣ Check for app configuration issues
Check the environment variables, config files and secrets supplied to your application. Depending on the environment (prod, dev, etc), you should be supplying the right set.

5️⃣ Check for Volume mount issues
Pods can crash if they don’t get the persistent volumes they require.
