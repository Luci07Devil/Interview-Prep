Dockerfile Interview Questions

When RUN and CMD instructions will be executed..??
RUN instruction will be executed while building the Docker Image.
CMD instruction will be executed while starting the Container.

Using COPY instruction,
We can copy local files and folders from docker build context to Docker Image.
These files and folders will be copied while creating a Docker Image.

ADD instruction works similar to COPY instruction but the only different is that we can download files from remote locations that’s from Internet while creating a Docker Image.

What’s the different between CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions..??
CMD instruction will be used to start the process or application inside the Container.

ENTRYPOINT instruction also works similar to CMD instruction.
ENTRYPOINT instruction will also be executed while creating a container.

CMD instruction can be overridden while creating a Container where as ENTRYPOINT instruction cannot be overridden while creating a Container.

When we have both CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions in a Dockerfile,
CMD instruction will not be executed and CMD instruction will be passed as an argument for ENTRYPOINT.
