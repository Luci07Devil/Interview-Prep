Packets=>encompasses senders Ip ,receivers IP , port numbers ,actual payload 
swithces => used when data transmission happen in same netowrk(intranet)
routers=> used when data transmission happen between two different network(Internet)


Application->At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application and adds headers to the application
Presentation->The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. and it can also handles encryption and decryption of data
session -> creates sesssion between the server and host
transport->The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of              data between systems and hosts
network-> receives data from data link layer and delivers them to destination network based on IP in the frames
data link->it receives data from physical layer and converts data into frames (packets of data and IP) using MAC and LLC 
           MAC-media access control provides flow control
           LLC-logical link control provides flow and error control from physical layer 
physical->it represents the electronical/optical transmission of binary data

How packets are transmitted from one place to another (Internet and intranet)

           data is wrapped as chunks of packets(SenderIP,receiverIp,ports and actual payload ),
           How data is gonna routed will be decided by route tables 
           Internet ->
             wrapped packets will be sent to Internet service provider equipments ,it passes more routers and network switches to reach destination network
           Intranet->
             wrapped packets will be sent to destination using network devices to destination netwrk
           once the packets reach the destination network ,it will be delivered to the destination IP and port number specified in the packets 
           once the packets reach the destination device , it will be reassembled to the proper sequence 
           then the destination devices process the data to serve as per the protocol
           
Ports and protocols:
