Establishing the connection (ACK ->ACKNOWLEDGE, SYN- SYNCHRONIZARION, FIN-No more data from sender), (C-client, S- server)

frame1-> C TO S =>SYN
frame2->S TO C =>ACK + SYN
C TO S => ACK => 

Ending the session

At the end of the session =>C TO S=>ACK + FIN
S TO C=> ACK
S TO C => ACK + FIN
C TO S=> ACK

three way handshake 

 client sends hello with client random and cipher supported
 server sends server random with public key certificate
 client encrypts pre-main secret with public key and sends to server which is 48 bytes of data 
 premain secrets is decrpyed in server side using private key 
 so the client and server creates session key from client random and server random and main secret and requests exchange will happen
